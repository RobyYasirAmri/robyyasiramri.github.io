Okay, on this occasion, I will write a review of lodging places in Lembang, Bandung.

This hotel is called Bamboo Village, located in Lembang, Bandung, to be precise in the area of Vila Istana Bunga.

## Rates per night
Here my friends and I stayed overnight in early November 2022. I got a price of Rp. 345,627 with Superior room type. This is quite expensive because it does not include breakfast.

Oh yes, I ordered through Agoda because the prices on Agoda were lower after comparing it with other websites.

Here are the pictures I took at the inn:

Then the inside of the room like this:

## Facilities
Then what can I get in this villa?
First, the view offered is perfect, with views of the mountains and the morning water which is very calm and cold, making it comfortable to linger to stay here.
Then the facilities are pretty good; there is a swimming pool that can be used at any time, and when I stayed, it was relatively quiet, so it felt like a private pool.
Just for standard room facilities, there is a TV which sometimes the signal is rather challenging, two mineral drinks of water, tea, coffee and a thermos for cooking warm water.
For the bathroom there is a heater so we don't have to worry about taking a shower at night because it's cold.

## Strengths and weaknesses
The drawbacks at this inn are toiletries such as soap, shampoo and toothpaste which are not immediately available on the spot. In other words, we have to ask the guard. And for shampoo, I still need to get it even though I had contacted the receptionist several times to send it, but the results were nil.
Then for service, it still needs to be improved, there is no telephone cable to contact the receptionist. Guests are only given a telephone number and must be ready to call credit. At that time, I had asked the guard's WhatsApp number to be shared, but the response was very long and not friendly.
Visitors coming for the first time will need clarification about where the receptionist is to get the room key. Luckily, at that time, I met security and asked where the receptionist was.
And there is no Wi-Fi listed on the website, so get ready to use a data plan, and the signal could be more explicit there.

## Closing
Overall this place is good for personal healing; the view and area are comprehensive. However, the service is still lacking; there is still a lot that needs to be improved in terms of service, especially for servers that are very unresponsive to visitors. So for friends who want to stay at this villa, you can think again.

Okay, that's enough for my review. I hope it can be a reference for friends looking for accommodation in the Lembang area, Bandung. thank you.
