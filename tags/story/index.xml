This hotel is called Bamboo Village, located in Lembang, Bandung, to be precise in the area of Vila Istana Bunga.
Rates per night Here my friends and I stayed overnight in early November 2022. I got a price of Rp. 345,627 with Superior room type. This is quite expensive because it does not include breakfast.</description></item></channel></rss>
